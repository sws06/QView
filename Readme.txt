## ‚ú® Key Features & Highlights (v1.4)

* **Advanced Context Engine (New in v1.4):** Go beyond simple replies with a powerful analytical tool. The completely overhauled Context Viewer now reveals deeper connections between posts, including:
    * **Shared Markers:** Instantly see all posts that share the same `[MARKERS]`.
    * **Time/Delta Matches:** Find posts made at the same `HH:MM` time across different days.
    * **Shared Themes:** View posts that are linked by common thematic tags.
    * **Mirrored Matches:** Uncover abstract patterns with connections based on mirrored dates, reversed post numbers, and reversed timestamps based on Q Clock logic.
    * **Navigation History:** A new **`< Back`** button allows you to retrace your steps while exploring complex context chains.

* **Comprehensive Data Exploration:** Access a sortable, searchable list of all Q posts, complete with timestamps, author details, and tripcodes.

* **Intuitive Post Viewer:** Experience a clean side-by-side layout for post text and associated images. The image panel now displays a welcome image on startup and can be resized, but not fully closed, to ensure you always see attached media.

* **Advanced Search & Filtering:** Precisely locate posts using keywords, numerical ranges, specific dates, or a dedicated **Theme Search**.

* **Intelligent Cross-Referencing:** Click on `>>` numbers to instantly navigate to quoted posts, featuring inline image previews.

* **Integrated Research Tools:** Right-click on selected text for direct searches on Google Books or Internet Archive, or to perform instant **Gematria calculations**.

* **Personalized Workflow:** Create local **bookmarks** and add private, customizable **notes** to any post. A new **"View All Notes"** option in the Tools menu lets you see all your annotations in one place. Notes can also optionally appear as tooltips in the post list.

* **Offline Archival:** Download and permanently store all linked images (from posts and quotes) and external web articles as local HTML files.

* **Customizable Interface:** Choose from **Dark, Light, or a patriotic Red, White & Blue (RWB) theme**. Your theme preference is saved automatically.
