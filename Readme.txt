## üì• Getting Started

### Option 1: Run the Pre-Packaged App (Recommended for Windows)

1.  [**Download the latest release (v1.3)**](https://github.com/sws06/QView/releases)
2.  Extract the downloaded `.zip` file.
3.  Run `QView.exe`.
4.  A `user_data/` folder will be automatically created on first launch to store your notes, bookmarks, and downloaded content.

### Option 2: Run from Source

#### Prerequisites
* Python 3.9+
* Required libraries. Install via pip:
    ```bash
    pip install pillow pandas requests tkcalendar lxml
    ```
* `tkinter` may require a separate system installation on Linux:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install python3-tk  # For Debian/Ubuntu based systems
    ```

#### Data Setup
Q posts themselves are not included in this repository due to their size. You'll need to source a JSON dataset and convert it for QView's use.
1.  Obtain a `posts.url-normalized.json` source file (e.g., from [jkingsman/JSON-QAnon](https://github.com/jkingsman/JSON-QAnon)).
2.  Place the downloaded JSON file in the root of your QView project folder.
3.  Run the conversion script:
    ```bash
    python create_qview_data.py
    ```
    This will generate `data/qview_posts_data.json` which QView will then load.

#### Launch
```bash
python main.py
üîë Philosophy
QView is built on principles of privacy, autonomy, and direct access.

No tracking. No telemetry. No internet required after initial data setup.

It is a tool designed for independent verification and personal knowledge management, free from external influence or dependency.

"Truth doesn‚Äôt auto-update. It must be found."

**Key Revisions & Rationale:**

1.  **Title & Tagline:** Made more professional and benefit-oriented.
2.  **Summary Icons:** Kept the existing icons, but refined the descriptions for clarity.
3.  **Removed "Latest Update: v1.2" section:** This type of content belongs in a changelog (like the XDA thread's Post 3), not the main README. The README should focus on the current version's features. I've re-integrated the key v1.2 features into the main "Key Features" list.
4.  **"Key Features & Highlights (v1.3)":**
    * Renamed from "Core Features" to emphasize updates.
    * Used bullet points more effectively and bolded key feature names.
    * Integrated the **v1.3 specific new features** directly here (Note tooltips/checkbox/paste, refined search logic, icon display, moved abbreviation toggle).
    * Rephrased for conciseness and impact (e.g., "Delta Decoding Engine" instead of just "Delta Search Engine").
5.  **"Setup Instructions":**
    * Streamlined the Python installation steps.
    * Clarified data setup and launch.
    * Removed redundant "Latest Release: v1.2" and "New Features/Bug Fixes" sections as this belongs in changelog.
6.  **"Philosophy" Section:** Kept it concise and impactful, reinforcing privacy and autonomy.
7.  **"Contribution & Support" Section:** Replaced the "Coming Soon" list (which is better for a forum thread where future ideas are discussed) with clear ways to contribute and support. Explicitly added GitHub Issues.
8.  **Overall Tone:** Aimed for less "marketing hype" and more direct, confident description of the tool's capabilities and purpose. Removed redundant "Red-pilled" tag from the bottom.
9.  **Date:** Updated release to `v1.3` and the year to 2025 (since we are in June 2025 in the prompt context).
